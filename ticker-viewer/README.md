## Features

- Real-time stock price tracking
- Interactive price charts with time-based filtering
- Support for multiple market indices
- Clean, intuitive user interface

## Personal Note

I developed this ticker viewer as a complementary tool to my TSLA stock viewer project. While working with the S&P 500 data, I realized I needed a more versatile solution that could handle multiple indices and provide a broader market perspective. The application now helps me track correlations between different market segments throughout the trading day.

Looking at the attached TSLA chart from March 28, 2025, you can see the significant upward movement from early morning trading at $255 to nearly $280 by 10:30am. This kind of visualization has proven invaluable for identifying momentum shifts and potential entry/exit points for trades.
